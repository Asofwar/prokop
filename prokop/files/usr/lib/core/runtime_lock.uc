// Runtime directory locks: reload.lock, subscription-update.lock, the latency
// test and component update check locks. Global lock order: service/state.uc.
//
// Same owner-record scheme as the config snapshot lock (config/snapshots.uc)
// and the autotune lock (autotune/lock.uc): the lock is a directory holding
// one "owner.<pid>.<start ticks>" record. The record is written into a
// private directory that an atomic rename then publishes as the lock, so no
// one ever sees the lock without its owner. The owner is the process named
// by the caller (a service/state.uc helper takes the lock for its caller). It
// holds the lock only while a process with that pid and start time runs: a
// dead owner or a pid reused by another process leaves a stale lock, which
// the next acquirer breaks. The name is unique per process lifetime, so
// breaking a stale lock or releasing one's own never removes the record of a
// lock that replaced it.
//
// The previous package version created the lock with mkdir and then wrote
// "<pid>\n[<start ticks>\n]" to <lock>/pid. Such a record holds the lock
// while its owner runs, like an owner record. A lock without any owner record
// is one whose creator has not written its pid yet: it counts as held for
// SETUP_GRACE_SECONDS, then as abandoned. One window stays open against a
// previous-version acquirer still running during an upgrade: its mkdir
// between our inspection and our rename leaves an empty directory that the
// rename replaces, and it then writes its pid into our lock. Closing it needs
// a rename that never replaces (renameat2 RENAME_NOREPLACE), which fs.rename
// does not offer.
