# A snapshot restore and an autotune apply while a failed lifecycle
# transition keeps its fail-closed guard (UC-019): the DPI guard table
# ProkopTableDpiGuard of a failed DPI rollback, or the prokop_transition_guard
# chain of a failed sing-box rollback. service/lifecycle.uc refuses every
# reload over them (runtime_guard_active) and only a restart removes them, so
# no reload proves a coherent runtime while one is left:
#   - one that is already there refuses the transaction before anything
#     changes: no restore guard, no pre-restore snapshot, no history event;
#   - one that a reload leaves behind (it exited 0, or it failed with the
#     guard kept) ends needs_attention with the reason runtime_guard_active:
#     the restore guard stays, last-known-working does not move, and no
#     success is recorded. After a failed target the previous configuration
#     is put back for the restart, without a rollback reload that would be
#     refused anyway; a rollback reload that leaves one behind ends the same.
# The guard is looked for after init.d released reload.lock. A lifecycle
# action that holds the lock by then (a WAN-up or hotplug reload, the holder
# a queued reload waited for) installs guards of its own for its transition:
# one seen while such an action runs counts as kept only once it ended.
