# A runtime directory lock (reload.lock, subscription-update.lock, the latency
# test locks) has exactly one owner (UC-011). The owner record is published
# together with the lock directory, so a lock that is still being set up is
# never taken for a stale one; the record names the owner by pid and start
# ticks, so a dead owner or a reused pid is stale; only the owner releases.
# A lock left by the previous package version (mkdir, then <lock>/pid) keeps
# its meaning across an upgrade: a live owner holds it, a dead one does not.
